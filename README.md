# Automatic Email Template

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a very easy project and a personal project. I deal with about 20 vendors a day and I need a specific weekly email from them so I can do my personal task. Personally, I cannot write 20 different emails every Monday as that will be time consuming. How can I make sure I am doing my task in a timely manner and still have time to review the emails and do other task.   

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I created a VBA form that will automcailly write an email based on my excel spreasheet. The VBA will run a loop through my list, create an email template with a specfic message including an attachment to a specfic email and it will automatically send. This saves a lot of time as I run it monday morning and it takes about less than a mintue to run. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I like to make it have a friendly environment field so anyone can use it. By clicking on the box under the mailbox, the macro will run.
